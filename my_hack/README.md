# TRI-DAO

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Disclaimer
This is a test dapp and should not be used in production.

This DAO contract:

- Collects investors money (JCL) & allocate shares
- Keep track of investor contributions with shares
- Allow investors to transfer shares
- Allow investment proposals to be created and voted
- Execute successful investment proposals (i.e send money)
- The number of votes an investor has is equivalent to the number of shares the investor has.

On deployment the contract has been set to 50 people max, 365 days of contributions, 1 hour for voting. But for the purpose of the demo, we reduced the contribution and voting time to 1 minute.
