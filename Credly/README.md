#### Project Description
Credly is a Community-NFT-as-a-service platform powered by Celo, providing an easy way for web3 communities to launch engagement NFTs.

#### Summary
This is where Community NFTs come into play. Imagine every web3 community issuing a soul-bound NFT to their community members that track both their on- and off-chain contributions to the community. And by doing so, easily visualizing their activity, comparing that with others, and in turn incentivizing users to further contribute to the community.
And this is exactly why we’ve built Credly. A Community NFT as a Service platform powered by Celo that allows web3 communities to seamlessly launch soul-bound NFTs for their community members.

#### Next Steps
This was a proof of concept built in the span of three weeks. But I am interested in continuing to pursue this project. My next steps will be as follows:
•	More metrics for XP and customized algorithms to make metrics more mathematically rigorous:
•	Adding Retroactive contributions (pre-NFT contributions)
•	Disincentivize disengagement (degrade stats over time if inactive)
•	Better responsive UI support
•	Testing and monitoring of service
I’m really excited to see a future where many web3 communities issue their members an exciting community NFT to not only track their engagement on-chain but also incentivize their contribution. Level up your community’s engagement with Credly.
