<h2> Inspiration ðŸ”¥</h2>
<p>

The original [celo composer](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-composer)  served as an inspiration for this project. I created this fork as an improvement to the original project because I noticed that the team was responding to PR and issue reports more slowly than I had anticipated. This is where you and I, as a community member, can help ðŸ˜Ž.
</p>

<p>
Making contributions to the original branch makes more sense, but given the response friction, I would prefer to work on this branch with community assistance while staying in contact with the Celo Devrel team to ensure that this project is in line with the original project's mission, which is to enable anyone to quickly build, deploy, and iterate on decentralized applications using Celo.

<h2> Bias ðŸ™ˆ</h2> 
Solidity, Node.js, and React are technologies that I have experience with, so they will be a large part of the earlier work. I would appreciate any contributions that would help flutter or React Native develop and support more mobile applications.
