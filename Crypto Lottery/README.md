## Project Name âš¡
- Crypto Lottery

#### Hackathon track
- Defi, SocialFi, Web3

##### Team Members
- Anton Masanavets, Solidity, Js developer (Minsk, Belarus)

#### Inspiration
The lottery is one of the most regulated spheres, because at the each stage fraud is possible. Unfortunately, in the online lotteries the things look most badly and most of famous lotteries don't have online versions. The smart contracts and blockchain help us to create honest and strong systems and we can use that for a lottery and Web2 to Web3 transformations.

#### What it does
The crypto lottery is similar as Powerball lottery in the United States. The player must choice the 5 numbers of 69 and 1 of 26 in the dapp. When round will end the player can claim a reward from the smart contract instantly without borders.

#### How I built it
I was doing research and tests for the find the optimized solution for scalability and the kind user interface. The solidity smart contract with React library and web3.js looks fine. I think, we must use minimal of technologies for the system stability.

#### Challenges I ran into
- Secure pseudo random in the Solidity
- Multichain support for the project.
- MultiWallet support for the project.
- Mobile wallet work

#### Accomplishments that I'm proud of
The honest blockchain lottery without the brokers. The easy and adopted UI UX for the players, security and scalability of crypto lottery.

#### What we learned
- Benefits of migrating Web2 apps to Web3
- Web3.js, Solidity

#### What's next for Crypto Lottery
- Production version
- Support more networks
- Add new functional (stake, swap and etc)
- Add mini games
- Add new wallets
