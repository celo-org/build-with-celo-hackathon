#### Project Description

ZENA is a web3 educational, mobile-first application that enables users to combine interactive learning with impact and climate action in a complexity reducing, hands on and gamified fun way.

With it's underlying LEARN to IMPACT concept ZENA aims to support young people in taking responsibility for themselves, for others, and for the world by providing infrastructure that connects web3 with climate resilience and the education system outside of crypto.

#### Summary
##### Describe the basic functionality of your project. What are the features you were able to implement? What features would you like to implement?

During Celo's hackathon, we have leveraged the project to a new level by focusing on ReFi and regenerative token engineering. ZENA has been evolving into a modular designed climate positive infrastructure for educational systems outside web3. By implementing the Toucan protocol into ZENA we now provide an infrastructure based on a LEARN to IMPACT concept. ZENA app users will earn CO2-backed tokens (BCT for now) by completing learning chapters and quests. After finishing a whole learning module these tokens can be exchanged into a certificate NFT, sequestering CO2. Later it will also be possible to retire carbon credits with ZENA and to earn a number of other eco credits.

Connecting Web3 with climate resilience is more than just futuristic technology it is also about how young people can find their place in the world. That’s what ZENA is aiming for with incentivising learning with real climate action.

#### Next Steps
#####  What do you need to do next to turn this prototype into a working solution?

-Invite initiatives and companies to act as funders for our gaming-like concept, so we’re able to gather BCT upfront and can incentivize youths to learn 
 and improve their knowledge for real-world impact rather than just levels, points, and high scores.

-Connecting with our local networks of teenagers and educators for testing and content creation.

-Add and connect to more eco credits (NCT, Rec token) and implement carbon retirement.

-Extend ZENA network within web3 with ReFi community (Toucan community, senken.io team, Regen Network etc.) and education focused communities (for example   UN's Giga & Patchwork Kingdoms)

-Looking into more ways to MAKE EDUCATIONAL IMPACT and on chain climate action INVESTABLE.
