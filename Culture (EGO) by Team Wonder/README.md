#### Project Description
Theme: Ecosystem Restoration

Name of Idea: Culture

About Idea:

Culture is a regenerative finance (Refi) ecosystem that highlights a wide range of features, such as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), decentralized finance (Defi) and non-fungible tokens  (NFTs). Its native token EGO, is exchangeable with the cUSD.

The EGO smart contract connects users IoT devices to our ecosystem when they acquire a Culture-partner  solar energy equipment and activate it.

The smart contract rewards users with EGO airdrops for every time they acquire a green-energy solution from our partners for the first time and also rewards them for the continuous consumption of the eco-friendly energy - solar. 

These rewards are made available in the users' Culture wallet and it can be recycled (as payment for more energy consumption), sold and transferred as fiat.

To give users more flexibility, the ecosystem  allows for Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) 

In the future, users would be rewarded for mining, acquiring and even building solar energy devices with Culture NFTs which can be minted and resold in the Culture marketplace.  

Hence, by making transactions in Culture, users are indirectly addressing climate change (as their source of power is green energy) and promoting ecosystem restoration, thereby changing the norm.
