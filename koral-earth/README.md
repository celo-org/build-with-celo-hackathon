#### Project Description
We are helping businesses and individuals to offset their carbon footprint by providing them with fundable, verifiable (blockchain-traceable), carbon-reducing projects thus ultimately contributing to the neutralization of greenhouse gas emissions in a transparent yet privacy-respected way.

Our project also helps with the distribution of funds via Celo to the Global South where the carbon-offsetting projects and environmental technologies are winning ground. In this, we will help onboard the next billion people to the crypto ecosystem and Celo in particular.

#### Summary
**Basic Functionality for the hackathon:**

- carbon footprint calculation tooling that sends privacy-enabled identifiable data on-chain
- present users with a list of carbon credits existing on a carbon-neutral on-chain like Celo
- ability to pay for offsetting using a celo-enabled payment channel

**Plan for the future** 

We intend to create an efficient, reliable, trustworthy and transparent carbon offsetting tooling to help corporate clients and individuals to reach their voluntary and regulatory commitments related to net-zero. As such, we see that we'd be building the following:

- Aggregate carbon credits and their projects (based on the metadata they contain); present them as offset offerings to users. Think bundles, subscriptions, packages, auctioning.

- Create carbon footprint trackers for individuals/businesses and store data privately either on-chain or on a de-storage. Think OpenMRV, Aztec, Ceramic + Lit Protocol, etc.

- Collector SDKs for existing carbon footprint tracking apps to collect data to be stored on-chain; 

- Automation toolings to put businesses ahead of the carbon offsetting curve. E.g. offsetting footprints before theyâ€™re created.

- Auditing toolings to give businesses an edge in compliance

- NFTs as a proof of offset to give individuals access to real-world green loyalty programs
