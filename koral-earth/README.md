#### Project Description
We are helping businesses and individuals to offset their carbon footprint by providing them with fundable, verifiable (blockchain-traceable), carbon-reducing projects thus ultimately contributing to the neutralization of greenhouse gas emissions in a transparent yet privacy-respected way.

Our project also helps with the distribution of funds via Celo to the Global South where the carbon-offsetting projects and environmental technologies are winning ground. In this, we will help onboard the next billion people to the crypto ecosystem and Celo in particular.

#### Summary
**Basic Functionality for the hackathon:**

- carbon footprint calculation tooling that sends privacy-enabled identifiable data on-chain
- ability to pay for offsetting using a celo-enabled payment channel
- ability to claim rewards using the Koral Protocol deployed on Celo

**Plan for the future** 

We intend to create an efficient, reliable, trustworthy and transparent sets of toolings to help corporate clients and individuals to reach their voluntary and regulatory commitments related to net-zero through the Koral Protocol.
