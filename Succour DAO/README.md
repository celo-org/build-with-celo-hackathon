#### Project Description
From our understanding of ReFI, our project idea for this hackathon is a two-part public funding platform on the Celo blockchain.
The first part of this funding platform involves writing a DAO smart contract. The DAO will work together to help solve pressing world issues.
Basically, individuals can participate in the DOA and they can suggest what world pressing issue to be solved, then every member of the DAO can vote with their voting power which is directly proportional to their share in the DAO.
The DAO would raise a certain amount, open to the public to contribute, and the issue with the highest vote will be attended to with the money raised.
World problems like water-borne diseases in Pakistan due to the flood, displacement of families and children in Ukraine, healthcare issues in Africa and climate change are examples of problems this project/DAO will help tackle.
The second part of this project involve another smart contract. This contract will be designed to allow a person or group of persons to raise a proposal and request for funding. When a request is made and contributions begin, no withdrawal can be made until the requested amount is reached or time-frame for the crowd-funding elapses.
