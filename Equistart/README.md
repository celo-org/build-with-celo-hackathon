## Equistart - The Dao Suite
#### Hackathon Track: DAOs / Valora

##### Region location: India

##### Team Members
- [Abhinil](https://github.com/t-phoenix) , Founder/ Full Stack Dev

- [Yakshesh](https://github.com/yaksheshgupta), Smart Contract Testing

#### Project Description
Equistart - The DAO Suite aims at creating a full stack DAO suite for a community to create their Decentralised Autonomous Organization with no code and mobile support. Creating a DAO is a tedious task with no single application providing an end-to-end solution and Information. With our dapp, users can easily mint their tokens, raise funds by selling parts of tokens, manage the raised funds (Treasury Management/ AMM), and finally Govern the project bound by tokens in a decentralized and autonomous fashion.

#### Summary
Internet unlocked a vast universe of new Applications over the past decades and now blockchain is 
revolutionising how we can manage our financial assets over the network of computers in a decentralised manner.
This idea can be extrapolated and can be used to build the future together in a cooperative DAO model.
