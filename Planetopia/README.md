#### Project Description
 Planetopia is a unique project built with the community in mind, so before deciding what aspect of Defi to explore, we took the time to make some findings, ask a few questions (collecting suggestions for both new and experienced Defi users).
 Planetopia get all of the features that define DEFI (Permissionless, Programmable, Transparent, Immutable, Interoperable, Non Custodial, etc.). We have made it easier to learn how DEFI works by adding innovative products like the Marketplace, Bridge, Game, Swap & Metaverse. The Marketplace allows you to create, trade and collect NFT's, the bridge allows you to move tokens across multiple chains, the Game allows you to earn money while having fun, the swap allows users to exchange paired tokens and the Metaverse gives you the feel of Virtual-reality and how it works. 

 A lot of research and surveys will be made into building Planetopia. Following months of research and consistent effort, we became addicted to making and interacting with unique concepts. With the blockchain as the medium, a passion to serve pushed the project forward irrespective of the fails.
