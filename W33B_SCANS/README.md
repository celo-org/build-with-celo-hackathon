#### Project Description

Currently many artist for novel, manga or comic has no credibility to monetize their content directly, while all centralised platform handled all of those profits. That will create disadvantages for artist because all of those centralised platforms cannot guarantee to protect their content to be copied ilegally by others and have no solutions to the artist. Even though those platforms are taking profit from readers, none of them offer valid solutions back to the artist, there's no transparency.

The reader community keeps growing, demands more ideas, and willing to support their favourite artist but there's uncertainity how to do it. With this we can create socialFi that will become the bridge by leveraging the power of blockchain.

This idea hopefully can engage more activities on the artist side, reader, new job opportunities, and the effectiveness protocol in the blockchain.

#### Summary

This SocialFi dApp will introduce the existing and growing reader community to the power of blockchain. This will help new artists to engage the community quicker and build up their popularity while taking direct profit through smart-contracts and governance by utilising other protocols from the blockchain. This will also open up more job opportunities for translators, enhance social impact between the innovator and the readers, and lead to other incentive programs.
