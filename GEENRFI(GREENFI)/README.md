The ReFi space is growing at an amazingly fast pace, every day we see new projects that aims to make our future even better. GeenrFi is an Platfrom where ReFi companies and projects can register to get crowd funding or get more visibility. GeenrFi aims to make it easier for individuals to find ReFi projects and track or help projects that aligns with their vision to create a positive future. Once the project or companies register GeenrFi will employ mechanisms for verifying the authenticity and once verified the projects will be onboarded on the platform. To improve transparency GeenrFi will provides ways for companies/project to share their updates with users interested in the project. Projects & companies will be rated & reviewed as per their performances by the users, based on the updates.
