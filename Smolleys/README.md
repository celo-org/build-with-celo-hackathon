### Project Description
Financial Discrimination Against Our Children. Integrating children in the modern digital economy and improving financial literacy as an essential part of our kids’ future.  Digital financial services could provide the perfect opportunity to serve our kids, teach them how to handle money and take care of building the right attitude with money.
We just need to rethink financial services... make them "speak" the kids' language.

The question to us now is how can Smolleys build and design the best digital bank for kids that will help parents to ensure their kids' financial future.
Smolleys explored this challenge with a purpose-driven banking app that provides insights on how an app could impact family relationships, create a good foundation for their kids’ financial future and ensure a successful inclusion of children in the modern digital economy.

### Summary
Almost 90% of all working-age Africans have no retirement savings. 9.5 in ten adults couldn’t cover a $50 emergency expense in sub  saharan Africa.* Adults struggle to manage their finances, but they want to see their kids grow up as successful people with good financial habits.
At the same time, 95% of parents don’t know how to discuss finances with kids in an understandable and enjoyable way.
For centuries, we have forced children to use the same stuff as adults, but finance still discriminates against children. Digital financial services could provide the perfect opportunity to serve our kids, teach them how to handle money and take care of building the right attitude.
We just need to rethink financial services... make them "speak" the kids' language.
The Smolleys team of expert UX architects and designers introduces a vision of a kids' banking app that can help prepare children for the digital economy and help parents teach their children the financial rudiments.

Smolleys aims to improve financial literacy as an essential part of our kids’ future and teach them how to handle money and take care of building the right attitude with money. We aim to achieve this by designing and building a kids’ digital bank
