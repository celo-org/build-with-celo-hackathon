#### Project Description
Flashmini is a blockchain platform which can be used to trade Cryptocurrencies and at the same time giving the members the advantage of pulling resources together which can be used to maximize profit on the trading platform.
A blockchain platform that allows people to pool resources together as a loan within the blockchain, and the members of the blockchain can borrow same loan for trading and other activities within the blockchain. It is a decentralized protocol that allows direct lending between borrowers and lenders to a pool-based strategy by providing liquidity, from which members can borrow from without a collateral, to carry on trading and other profit activities. 
It is more like integrating Flashpool into flashbot. Flashmini gives the members the ability to trade on the platform with Flashbots, and at the same time increasing the stake for profit by creating a pool that members can tap into.

How is the FlashMini network secured?
The FlashMini blockchain has a network for developers and programmers who are always on the alert  to notice any nefarious move on the platform. Also, The App will be updated and the Password changed regularly to avoid it being hacked from the outside. Also, an extended caution will be taken by placing an additional option to monitor irregular activities and notify the programmers for the network immediately.
As a blockchain-based Web3 platform, Flashmini is secured by incredibly strong cryptographic defenses — making it practically impossible to crack.
