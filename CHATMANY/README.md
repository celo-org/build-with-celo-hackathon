#### Project Description
Provide a clear statement of the challenges/issues/problems/gaps your project engages as well as a brief, high-level description of how your project engages the areas you've identified. What is the value of your approach? Who are the intended users?

Chatting is the major way for everyone to connect and stay in touch with their loved ones. In urgent and compromising situations, chatting still remains the best way to draw the attention of people whose help you might need. 
Chat many is a social app with wallet-like integration that is built on the Seno blockchain.
It has a remote signer protocol that facilitates an end-to-end encrypted connection between wallets. 
These wallets integrate the release candidate to leverage cutting-edge features such as simultaneous multi-chain support, to allow users to send transactions to different chains at the same time. These features reflect Chat many’s agnostic approaches, as it seeks to empower users wherever they choose to interact with web3, delivering an experience that is as seamless as it is secure.


#### Summary
Describe the basic functionality of your project. What are the features you were able to implement? What features would you like to implement?

A next-generation app with wallet-like integration for chatting enthusiasts and keeping in touch with friends, family, and acquaintances to break protocols of sending and receiving crypto. 
Features include:
* Sending free messages and allowing users to share memes, pictures, and videos.
* Chat between any two wallets, regardless of device: Any two users of a Chat many can engage in chat. This is a significant departure from web2 chat services, where users must be on the same platform to do so.
* Participate on your terms: To be discoverable, users must opt-in, in which case they can be discovered by their wallet address. Those who choose to restrict discoverability can also chat with others by sharing their details via a QR code or link.
* Use one tool for messaging and crypto: Users can send messages alongside crypto transactions, simplifying the experience and laying the groundwork for future use cases.
* Own your chat history: All messages are encrypted and only the chat’s participants can read them. Users can exercise self-custody of their message history, making it privacy-preserving and censorship-resistant.
* Keep your keys private: Chat many decouples wallet keys and respects users’ privacy.
