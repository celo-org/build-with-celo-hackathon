#### Project Description
Dygnify protocol for real world lending - A decentralised credit infrastructure for connecting digital asset investors to investment opportunities (Credit Funds, FinTechs) in real world.


#### Summary
Dygnify is a provider of decentralised credit infrastructure for connecting digital asset (crypto) investors to investment opportunities linked to SMB economic activity. We have implemented a use case of a Credit Fund as a borrower, who in turn is aggregating/lending to small businesses.
We believe access to decentralized finance can help solve the financial inclusion problem sustainably by bringing the following benefits: 

1. For the borrowers – 
a. Tapping global digital asset liquidity bringing sustainable lower-cost solution for emerging market borrowers 
b. Accessing Blockchain based on-chain borrowing, which is fast, secure and creates an immutable credit track record which can open the flood gates to capital.

2. For the investors – * 
a. Empowering any digital asset holder to become a lender, backing real-world economic activity 
b. Stable, sustainable yields (10-25%) delinked from crypto volatility.

#### Next Steps

1.	We plan to build a progressively decentralised community (DAO) of underwriters, auditors, service providers, asset originators, developers and investors; with an incentive mechanism designed to yield good behaviour, can solve for centralised decisioning across the network.
2.	We plan to build the protocol as an infrastructure toolkit to serve three purposes: 
a. Taking away crypto and DeFi complexity for users 
b. Providing on+off chain reputation & identity management, regulatory compliance 
c. Enabling Security and Privacy Example – tools for on+off chain credit scoring, Reputation management, whitelisting, compliance, decentralised data storage, dash boards etc. with encryption and security features built-in.
