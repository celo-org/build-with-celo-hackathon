#### Summary
We outline here an idea that would allow decentralized donations and crowdfunding of projects that aim to re-value people in harsh economic and personal conditions by providing them with psychological support and access to education and job opportunities.

Through blockchain, we solve the classic transparency issue of donation systems and prove to donors their contributions benefit the person or cause. As an innovation compared to classical donations, we introduce project checkpoints (every project is an NFT associated with the given person; the contract also manages the project's funds). Checkpoints define all the steps in the person's re-valuation path, safeguard donors by partially refunding contributions if something goes wrong, and provide the stakeholders with a way to monitor and evaluate the progress of the beneficiary of the donation.

You can find a draft of the application flow in the project's GitHub wiki. More details will be added to the wiki over the next week. https://github.com/ricCap/projectz/wiki/Flowchart
