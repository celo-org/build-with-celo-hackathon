Introduction

Empowering conservation Land fragmentation in the Maasai  Mara landscape manifested in the closure of wildlife corridors is one of the significant challenges fronting the conservation efforts of some of the world's endangered species.

This problem has translated to reduced ranges and increased human-wildlife conflict in the Massai Mara.

Consequently, to coexist in harmony with nature, the pastoralist community in the Mara-Siana Conservancy, courtesy of WWF-Kenya, has taken up conservation as their responsibility.

This community has progressively changed the negative perception of wildlife as problematic animals through owning the change process. This has further translated to reduced retaliatory killings of nature, especially elephants and lions.

BACKGROUND

A community uniting to secure habitats for wildlife has led to several social-economic benefits and the mitigation of human-wildlife conflict within the iconic Maasai Mara. The Mara-Siana is a critical migratory corridor for the African Elephant. It hosts the big 5 as well as other spectacular wildlife that draws tourists from near and far.

Unfortunately, the Maasai  Mara is also home to the iconic Maasai community, who roam this vast land grazing their livestock. Over time, poor land management, unplanned settlement, and fencing led to the disappearance of critical wildlife habitats. As a result, the human-wildlife conflict became familiar with the loss of livestock, wildlife, and even human life. More than 8,000 acres of land within the Mara Siana was initially a group ranch but later converted to private land, with each of the 1,251 land owners being allocated 42 acres of land.

Previously, some homesteads were inside the Siana valley in the year 2013. Some of the community landowners approached a donor with the intention of leasing and establishing Siana Conservancy to make it a success. They were informed from the case studies which are now thriving, like Naboisho, Mara North and Olare, and other conservancies in the Maasai Mara. To develop grass banks for their livestock during the drought season To benefit financially To get employment opportunities in the conservancies and camps that are operating in the conservancies From learnings of other neighbouring conservancies, the land owners soon came to realize how they could benefit and earn income from conservation efforts.

The primary motivation factors that compelled the communities to form the conservancies include; 1. 2. 3. Each land owner contributed 6.5 acres. Landowners within the identified core conservation area also agreed to relocate to the earmarked human settlement zones. Key to the conservancy was the partnership between the land owners and the tourism investors.

The discussions materialised when the tourist partners and camp directors came together and raised money to pay the leases. That has been really key and has been cemented by the community by giving camp directors a 15-year lease. The communities receive annual land rents, and then 20 dollars per guest per night goes to the kitty of the land owners' account.

The land owners would create the space for wildlife to thrive in suitable habitats, while the tourism investors would attract business to the camps. Since the community moved from the valley, there has been a significant impact. There is more wildlife coming in. In terms of livelihood, communities realized the benefits of the conservancies.

The landowners started receiving cash benefits, and the value of conservations began to get slowly into them. And that is why they were willing to give part of their land to go into the conservancy. After a while, hundreds of landowners started staging demonstrations over poor management by conservancy officials. Management agreements become a double-edged sword where money donated by donors was abused by the private conservancies hence low returns to the land owners.

Not only were these private conservancies not transparent, but also heavily flawed. These flaws included poor management, lack of accountability, taking land without permission, issuing threats, and locking money for landowners. These issues have been faced by landowners in Maasai Mara up to date. The Problem in a nutshell Lack of transparency and visibility in the disbursement process and usage of donor funds. Repeat players and in-person interactions.

Funding does not reach the intended parties, posing a threat to the Maasai Mara ecosystem and the economic stability of stakeholders. Centralized control and access to information by certain personnel e.g. the conservancies' management. Low public accountability and participation in the decision-making process and conservation processes.
