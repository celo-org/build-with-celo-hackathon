## SUCCOUR DOCUMENTATION

Succour is a non-profit philanthropic organization that comprises of a *Decentralized Autonomous Organization [DAO]* and a *Crowd-Funding platform*.  
Succour is established to reach out to as many people around the world by lending a helping hand to individuals, communities, cities, states, countries and industry sectors.  
Succour's operation is backed by code running on a decentralized blockchain.  

### How Does Succour Work?

#### SUCCOUR DAO
Succour DAO is made up of philanthropic individuals who constantly make contributions to help resolve problems around the world.

###### Joining The DAO
To join the Succour DAO, you will be required to fill in your name and amount with which you are joining the DAO. A minimum of 5,000SDK and a maximum of 200,000SDK are the fees required to join the DAO.  
*NOTE: These fees are subject to change as the DAO grows and members can increase their stake in the DAO.*
All joining the DAO have to be people willing to be committed to giving without getting profits in return.  

##### Member Percentage
Percentage of each member is the balance of that memeber multiplied by 100 all divided by the DAO's total balance. It is the percentage of the DAO each member holds.  

##### Vote Power  
The voting power of each member of the DAO is the amount of influence every member has on a proposal. It is calculated based on every member's holding in the DAO.  

##### Proposing Projects  
Seeing that Succour DAO is made up of individuals who are motivated to help in every capacity they can, every member can bring up problems around the world they want the DAO to contribute to solving.  
The proposer gives a title, describes the problem, proposes a solution and proposes an amount for the project. The proposal is automatically listed to be voted on by other members of the DAO.  
Upon proposing the a project, the proposer accordingly becomes the first to vote on that project and would not be able to on the same project again.  

##### Voting On Projects  
Immediately a project is proposed, it is listed among projects to be voted on by members of the DAO.  
The voting power of each member plays a crucial role in the passing of any proposal. Fotr a proposal to pass, votes on it have to be up to 70% of the total voting power of the DAO.  
Once a proposal passes, 60% of the proposed amount is allocated to it from the DAO.  

##### Donating To A Proposed Project  
The DAO opens donation to a project to the public.  
The DAO makes at least 60% contribution to every project and allows the public to make donations to meet up with what is left.  

##### Withdraw For Project Execution  
When the amount proposed for a project is reached, it is withdrawn for the execution of that project.  

##### Leaving The DAO  
Any member of the DAO that chooses to leave will have to make a withdraw request. The withdraw request is processed for a duration of 14 days after which the member can withdraw their holding from the DAO.  
*The developers are working on a cancelWithdraw functionality that would allow members who decided to remain in the after requesting to withdraw to cancel that request.*  


### SUCCOUR CROWD-FUND  

Understanding that there are individuals that would be in need of funding, which is something not within the operations of the DAO, Succour decided to have a *Crowd-funding* platform.  
This is in line with Succour's mission to help everyone.  

##### Create Funding  
On the Succour Crowd-Funding page, users can open a fund by stating their name, explaining their need and the amount needed. It is listed alongside other funding requests as soon as the request is submitted.  

##### Donating To Funding Requests  
When a request is submitted, it is open to donation from everyone.  

##### Withdrawing Donated Funds  
Succour fundees can only withdraw their funds when donations have reached at least the amount requested.  

>Succour Crowd-Fund is open to anyone in need of financial support.


#### FUTURE UPDATES TO SUCCOUR  
The Succour team is committed to building and making improvements. Therefore, as part of the future upgrade to Succour, there will be a move from Succour DAO Tokens to Celo Dollars.  
Another update is a 1% commission on every crowd-fund on the *Succour Crowd Fund*. The 1% commission will be credited to members of the Succour DAO. It is important to note that this will only come up when Succour is fully developed and used by many.
