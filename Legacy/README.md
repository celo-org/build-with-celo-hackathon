#### Project Description
     - Legacy is a decentralised asset security organization focused on building an alternative for retrieving lost or possibly lost decentralised assets in cases of asset owner's death, misplacement of assets passwords or key phrases which can result in permanent loss of these decentralised assets.
These decentralised assets which includes cryptocurrencies, NFTs e.t.c cannot be retrieved because there is NO singular (centralised) body in care of these assets; because it is on the blockchain.
#### Summary
     - With Legacy, decentralised finance (defi) adopters/users will be able to secure their assets in case of death/wallet misplacement by setting a duration of dormancy to when if elapsed Legacy will send all or specific number of  assets into another wallet; either a next of kin's if in case of death of asset owner
or a secondary wallet in case of wallet misplacement.
