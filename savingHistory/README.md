#### Project Description

Every culture on the planet provides its own answer to the big question of 'What is it to be human?' They form our repertoire for dealing with the challenges facing us as a species in the millennia ahead. As a result, the loss of any culture affects humanity.

savingHistory is an application layer protocol designed to protect the endangered heritage of different tribes worldwide while creating awareness of their way of life globally. It enables endangered tribes to have their own online museum stored on the blockchain to tell their stories for years to come.

savingHistory mission is to preserve endangered cultures around the world by documenting history, beliefs, customs, and social behavior in the form of articles, images, audio, and videos. As a result, an online museum for endangered minority cultures is being created.

#### Summary

The savingHistoryDAO and $SAVEH token will serve as the global governance medium, empowering $SAVEH holders through decision-making and reward mechanisms.

A proposal to preserve a particular culture will be raised by a curator/volunteer who holds at least 100k $SAVEH tokens. The savingHistoryDAO members will vote to accept/decline the proposal, as it must meet certain standards. Tokens are awarded to members who participate in voting and decision-making.

After a proposal is accepted, the curator goes ahead to do the necessary research and creates a well-documented report on the culture. This report must meet the platform’s standards and will be evaluated by a council of experts (historians, professors, e.t.c) nominated by $SAVEH holders. The council members can be removed or promoted by $SAVEH holders based on their performance.
If the report is accepted by the council, it will be published on IPFS and the curator will be rewarded with cUSD. The documented culture will be live on the platform’s website.
