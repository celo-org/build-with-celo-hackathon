#### Project Description
Provide a clear statement of the challenges/issues/problems/gaps your project engages as well as a brief, high-level description of how your project engages the areas you've identified. What is the value of your approach? Who are the intended users?

- Quatre-finance is a platform for decentralized applications. We aim not to completely uninstall the application world but re-emphasizing the need for true decentralization. while building decentralized products tailored to individual needs putting users in complete control of their funds and/or investments, our concepts are not limited to the following:

Our core product and ideology is centered around creating a platform for users to easily access contributed funds/loans via a rotational peer-to-peer system for a short period of time usually 7 to 255 days.

We also allows traders and crypto holders to earn in different ways such as lending out their assets to be used by another while retaining the ownership at the same time earning lender's interest.

Traders looking to borrow on a short-term basis, can join the Q-core pool, move it to exchange to make more profits leveraging on their existing portfolio as collateral. In this pool, they also become a lender.

With Quatrefinance decentralized lending protocol (Q-Lend), fund owners who wish to play safe and retain full ownership and control of their funds can unilaterally set up (from our proxy-based) a public - private inclined exchange for themselves where they can lend platform-compatible assets to others at a profitable interest. The goal is to create a competitive interest atmostphere where lenders give out loan at a rate they are most convenient with.

Our incentivized program (s) allow investors, liquidity provider and participants in the network to make more from their commitments, time and participation.

## Problems
- Barriers to fast adoption posed by centralized blockchain operators such as rigorous KYCs etc.
- Trust issues between parties to trade.
- Inherent security issues with decentralized operators.
- Loss of fund in the event of demise.
- Low adoption due to technical nature of blockchain technology.

## Our Solutions
We are creating a protocol that removes the need for trust.
A truly decentralized platform with no kyc.
Raising standards above the limit of existing decentralized operators.
Better user interface and integration to accomodate average internet users.
Improve wallet service to reduce funds being stolen or locked forver.

## Mission
To build decentralized protocols, using blockchain technologies in a trustless environments that manage both financial and non-financial relationships between parties.

## Highly Decentralized
Even with some decentralized finance platforms, you're still at the mercy of someone. At Quatre-finance, you decide which way to go: if your decision is fairly reasonable enough regarding the rights of your counterparties.

Our products and core value will always consider a four-sided properties thus:

- Own it.
- control it.
- be fair.
- trust less.

1. Own it
Quatre products gives the fulfilment of ownership. Most of our products are (and will be) designed to brings you ownership experience. Accessility to your funds are hashed with your signature and you don't have to be at the mercy of any centralized exchange platform to bring in or take take out your funds. We build it : you own it.

2. Control it
Knowing you're in control is the first assurance of security.

Control is preceded by ownership. In fact they go hand in hand. The Quatre protocol brings you a high level of control over your assets/funds. If you engage in any of the Quatre-finance's p2p products, control is mutual while you also retain a good amount of ownership.

3. Be fair
We believe in fair dealings. While control and ownership belongs to the user, we on the fair side ensures that counterparties in any transaction are fairly treated without jeopardizing your need for control.

4. Trust less
This is an inherently-interesting blockchain feature that Quatre-finance builds upon. With this, Alice does not need to know or have Bob's trust in order to transact with him. Quatre protocol gives you rest of mind even while the identity of the other party is preserved.

## Technology.
The Quatrefinance's protocols will be built on EVM compatible networks (we may extend to more technologies in the future as our mission statement requires that we consistently build on the same Quatrefinance platform). From our research, we are looking to extend to one or more technologies:

Every EVM compatible technologies have one or more uniqueness (es). Some factors we consider:

Should be Ethereum virtual machines compatible. That is, capability of executing smart contracts instructions which we deem suitable for implemeting our backend written in solidity language.

With considerably low transaction fees.

Should encourage Borderless decentralized finance (DeFi) that allows anyone around the globe with an internet service to access our services.

Among others, its performance should be suitable for mass adoption.

We are leveraging on the use cases of blockchain technology such as the distributive, permissionless and immutability features via smart contract architecture, we established Quatre-finance protocol that inherits the modern blockchain attributes with customised rules.

We see Celo platform as on best to help us achieve our dream.

#### Summary
As of now, Quatre Digesu provides users with features as follows:

## Create basic and interactive account
On Digesu, each user is required to create a Non EOA ie we simply launch an interactive contract that is mapped and attached to the user. 
- Why this account?
We need to make things easier for our users, part of which CELO has made available for us. We planned to make Quatre digesu and subsequent application (s) esily accessible for an average person who really can't afford the time and constraints of using decentralized applications. An interactive account will play a semi-custodial role for interacting with the Dapps. User will be abe to deposit, make transfer requests, pay for collaterals, reward, give and withdraw permission to it. 

Our aim of leveraging this model is to bring the users closer as much as possible giving then the best experince they could ever get in the web3 space.

## Create or Launch a new band. 
Users can create a band meant purposely for peer or external contribution using the interactive account. This could be a priate or public pool.
  - A private pool is closed to peers only. Only the preregistered peer addresses can participate in such contribition.
  - On the other hand, public band is general and open to the public or anyone to participate. This is one of the interesting solutions we provide which is not available traditionally.

## Join a band
Digesu gives ample benefits to users as they control and choose that which they want.
Theu could either create a fresh pool or participate in an existing pool.

## GetFinance
When the required number of participants in a pool is achieved, the balance in such pool is available to the next on the queue (treated as first come first served) to getFinance.

## Payback
when an user gh i.e getFinance from a band, they must pay back, usually without interest but with a minimum taker fee.

## Liquidate
Since the model of Digesu relies on other peoples' fund, then digesu treats them as an important factor in the success of the platform hence if a GFer defaults in payment, they can be liquidated. more information on this is provided in the documentation.

## Complete a round
Each pool has a cycle, and we regard it as a round. if there are 4 people in a pool preset with 3 days duration, then a round is 12 days in total.

## Other functionalities we hope to add sooner

We want to make Digesu as friendly as possible plus helping users maximize the user of borrowed funds. We plan to integrate with yield protocols so users can simply connect, trade, exchange and perform other activities such as staking with a click.

#### Next Steps
We are indeed committed to this project owing to a lot of work we have input. With out plans and roadmap, if we get supports in the way we should, we plan to lauch in Q4, 2022 to max of Q2, 2023. We look forward to build on Celo. 

## About the Dapp
We have so far:
- Written the smart contracts for our token,
- Written a few tests,
- Build the frontend both desktop and mobile.

## DApp
From the directory : `quatre-digesu-on-celo-hackathon`

`cd quatre/backend/hardhat-ts`    `: as the smart contract directory`
`cd quatre`                       : `for mobile development.`
`cd quatre/webversion/quatreweb`  : `desktop application.`

## KeyNote
Although the project is not complete up our expection due to lack of manpower. The frontend developer had since been on sick bed for weeks. I had to only work on both sides. Due to limited time, I spinned up the web app but couldn't complete it. 

A vote of thanks to the Celo team and the developers for making the journey smooth.


We look forward to continue building this dApp to a success.
