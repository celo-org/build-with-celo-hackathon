#### Project Description
Project description
There is a generally held view that modern media is there and now more than ever, neutral, and apolitical and solution-driven information dissemination is paramount. 
Senchat is a decentralized social platform that is designed to give members of its community the opportunity to discuss and give solutions to different topics drawn from a pool of trending topics largely generated from, but not restricted to such areas as education, the environment, entrepreneurship and other social issues deemed less appealing by mainstream media. 
Problems
The sensationalism in media raises stories of or tinged with murders, sex scndals and politics above less sensational ones that tackle education or problems faced by average people – so called news deserts.
High level of inaccuracies in reports due to the pressure of mainstream media to please certain advertisers because of profit or please their political bills.
Agenda selling in modern media has led to lack of diversity and trivialization of the priorities of society.
The buying of individual media outlets by larger media corporations has led to the reduction of choice and an increase in propaganda and partisan messaging.
Solutions
Discussions on the Senchat platform are mainly solution-driven, topics are chosen for the consideration of all members of the community and solution are proffered. Workable solutions are then given life by funding through NFT sales, where a particular percentage is set aside for bringing real time solutions to real time problems.
Being apolitical and neutral, Senchat evades the pressure faced by mainstream media to please certain advertisers or political bases.
Senchat is a platform that in addition to chatting also gives access to sending and receiving nfts in the marketplace.
