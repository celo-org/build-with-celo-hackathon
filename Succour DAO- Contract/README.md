#### Project Description
From our understanding of ReFI, our project idea for this hackathon is a two-part public funding platform on the Celo blockchain.
The first part of this funding platform involves writing a DAO smart contract. The DAO will work together to help solve pressing world issues.
Basically, individuals can participate in the DOA and they can suggest what world pressing issue to be solved, then every member of the DAO can vote with their voting power which is directly proportional to their share in the DAO.
The DAO would raise a certain amount, open to the public to contribute, and the issue with the highest vote will be attended to with the money raised.
World problems like water-borne diseases in Pakistan due to the flood, displacement of families and children in Ukraine, healthcare issues in Africa and climate change are examples of problems this project/DAO will help tackle.
The second part of this project involve another smart contract. This contract will be designed to allow a person or group of persons to raise a proposal and request for funding. When a request is made and contributions begin, no withdrawal can be made until the requested amount is reached or time-frame for the crowd-funding elapses. 


#### Summary
We have made this project as user-friendly as possible; with a front-end connected to the smart contract users can easily join the Succour DAO, propose projects, donate to projects execution and withdraw from he DAO if they wish. Creating crowd funding, donating, and withdrawals have also been made easy.
We have also implemented the Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard-EIP-1822 for easy upgradability of the smart contract.

#### Next Steps
For succour to turn into a working solution, a lot of publicity has to be done to draw the attention of as many as possible to join the DAO and make us of the Decentralized Crowd-Funding platform.
