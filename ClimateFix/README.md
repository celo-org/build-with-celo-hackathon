#### Project Description
We want to help eradicate or reduce the issues of the ozone layer depletion, erosion, noise pollution, air pollution, and a few more with encouraging people to plant trees around communities.

Our solution basically allow people earn CELO tokens when they plant a tree or when they volunteer to help make confirmations for planted trees, hence, saving the climate and also helping people earn an income. Planting these trees do not only help the community in which it is planted, but also helps the horizon's depletion of the world.

#### Summary
When a user onboards on the app, they pick whether they would want to plant or volunteer to make confirmations on trees planted. For the planters, they send a video of them planting the tree, along side the type of tree, and their location. We then add their plant to our tracking system list and then put out the location for wanted volunteers to help check in a few months time for validation. The planter gets their token reward after confirmation and monthly as they send in proofs of taking care of the plant. The tokens would be fully available for transactions after a period of gathering planters to have done enough of planting to help the global climate change.
We also look into implementing a farm market space on the app to get planting tools.
