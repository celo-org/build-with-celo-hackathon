#### Project Description
Construction of a new building can cause harm to the environment in many ways. Things negatively impact the environment include: 

    CO2 emissions – According to an article published in Bold Business, the construction sector contributes to 25% – 40% of the world’s carbon emissions. 
    Waste – The process of constructing new infrastructure produces a lot of waste that ends up in landfills.
    Burning of fossil fuels – The construction process requires the burning of fossil fuels which produces greenhouse gases and harms the environment. 
    Harming wildlife – During construction, clearing vegetation and excavating can destroy wildlife and habitats.
    
#### Summary
EcoConstruct addresses the primary issues in maintaining a strong environment friendly construction industry. Some of the features that will be implemented with Celo Block chain are :

    Tracking  energy efficiency of buildings
    Setting and Tracking emission reduction targets
    Tracking and Minimizing the discharge of pollutants (waste)
