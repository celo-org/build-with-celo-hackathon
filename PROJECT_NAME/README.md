## Project Description

#### _Provide a clear statement of the challenges/issues/problems/gaps your project engages as well as a brief, high-level description of how your project engages the areas you've identified. What is the value of your approach? Who are the intended users?_

India being a land of agriculture has played a pivot role in the life of farmers for their survival. The government of India has many programmes and finance plans for providing them funding and support like

- _Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maan Dhan Yojana_
- _Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi_
- _Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana_

These government programmes provide the necessary requirements but the main problem is the distribution of these financial plans from different hierarchy to grass root level is declining day by day. Problem faced by farmers are a collective problem for our environment. Lack of Technology, resources and financial aid is leading to the cause of death of farmers in India.

In order to eradicate this problem we as a team have decided to take our collective ideas to develop a system which contains all these information and facilities at one place for the suitable working of financial policies in the agricultural department of India.

How are we going to implement it is the next question, so to answer that we have a few points we want to mention :

- In the agricultural department of India the facilities provided to the farmers are through incentives from the government under different government programmes. Each programme has a certain amount of money and this money is directly transferred into the bank account of the farmer but here is the most bizzare part of this situation. The family member of some farmer declare them to be dead and try to acquire the government money and use that for their own benefit. So to eradicate this problem we have designed this system to provide a unique user private key and provide them a qr scanner which directly links their account and unless they use it they don't get the money which eradicates any type of fradulency.

- The need of farmers to grow their farms and agriculture is to bring new technology and crops to increase fertility. So, to bring out the best technology, crops and chemicals for better growth we are planning to implement a super market for the farmers to provide them with the best possible facility.
