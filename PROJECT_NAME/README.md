#### Project Description
### PROBLEM STATEMENT
* Because of increasing concern about global climate change and carbon emissions as a factor, many companies and organizations are pursuing ‘carbon footprint’ projects to estimate their own contributions to global climate change. 
* Our project describes the development and use of a footprint calculator. By answering simple questions about your daily-life you can quickly estimate the amount of CO2 emissions generated within the areas of home life, what you eat, travel, as well as holiday. 
* We describe how the tool integrates information with user-inputted data; allows users to compare their footprint with others in their community; and presents them with targeted pledges to help them reduce their impact. Based on the output from our web app, people can reduce their carbon emissions in the society.

### OBJECTIVES 
* The main objective of the project is to estimate our footprint mainly caused because of home energy, transportation and waste. 
* Such tools can help individuals to see the impact on their consumption on emissions and help promote alternative behaviors towards a sustainable environment.

### IMPLEMENTATION Software Requirements: 
* Operating System: Windows versions 8 or 10.
* Languages used to Develop: Python, HTML, CSS.
* Technologies used: Streamlit (for frontend), web3 (for handling transactions).
* Debugger and Emulator: Any Browser.

### Modules: 
## 1.Prediction Module 
• User just needs to input their emission details like consumption (e.g., fuel, transport, project travel, energy, material use); waste (e.g., domestic waste, electrical and electronic equipment) with the questions asked. Therefore, the graphical user interface is user friendly and straightforward. 
• The computation commences as soon as this data is made accessible to the model, and the needed result is produced. 
• The server delivers the co2 equivalent outputs as a response to the request when the models give them, and these values are then presented in the User Interface. 
• Users can download the reports of their emissions.

## 2.Donation Module 
• This module involves collecting funds to protect our amazing planet by building effective solutions to big environmental challenges. 
• We haved used python web3 for making and deploying smart contract. Once we have deployed smart contract on the blockchain. We will interact with smart contract using streamlit API to store transactions.

### FUTURE SCOPE 
The proposed work can be used by individuals as well as public users. Hopefully, the power of footprint calculators would boost the knowledge of users over the years. Also much progress has been made in household areas , extending the field for corporate areas and multilingual support has to carried out as a future work.
