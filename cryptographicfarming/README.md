#### Project Description
Provide a clear statement of the challenges/issues/problems/gaps your project engages as well as a brief, high-level description of how your project engages the areas you've identified. What is the value of your approach? Who are the intended users?
1)Our DAO can accept cryptos from any wallet and keep tracks of the wallet 
2)Organisers are the ones who declares a farmer by verifying their identity and the land they own.
       i) Here not everyone who declares can become a farmer the farmer who has only paid a minimum fee proportional to the land they own, can be declared as farmer
       ii) The farmer can also withdraw their cut which will be proportional to the land they own and the weightage of the damage caused by which is determined by our algorithm.


#### Summary
 Our DAO will supply the donated amount or the amount collected from the farmers to the farmers who are in need like an insurance company.
 The farmers who are in need are determined by some good souls(called as activists in our project).they are also paid according to the votes they gained from the farmers.
 Our farmers can withdraw money when 90 percent of the farmers agree to take the money.
