#### Project Description
The promise of blockchain technology was to create a revolutionary financial system that eliminates third-party and central control from transactions, and still guarantee trust, transparency, and true ownership. Thus the blockchain technology itself was a gateway for exchanging financial value in a relatively faster, secured, cheaper way. This was quite simple as bitcoin was perceived to be the medium for these transactions.  Today, the blockchain ecosystem has undergone several changes with newer goals and use cases identified for the technology. Also, various blockchain technology has been developed for specific use cases with each creating new assets or tokens. Further, these blockchain operate in their own silo ( without communicating with other existing blockchains, and make little attempt to make it easier for other blockchain to communicate with them). To also add up to the diverse nature is the fact that on each blockchains there are not just the native asset but also other high liquidity privately owned but open assets that have a high patronage.

As the buzz of blockchain reaches far and wide, more people are interested in using the technology. It is expected that nearly 75% of retailers will accept either cryptocurrency or stablecoin payments within the next two years, according to a June (2022) survey conducted by Deloitte.  Starbucks began accepting crypto payments for its coffee, and Dallas Mavericks also sells tickets for crypto. According to Leon Buck, the National Retail Federation’s vice president of banking and financial services, in  Cryptocurrency and its role in retail, "All retailers are looking into it".
Yet the diverse and technical nature of the blockchain ecosystem presents a challenge to them. 

As  Eric Chason stated in the same article,  “Retailers that want to handle crypto directly would need to feel comfortable with the underlying technology and their ability to convert the crypto into U.S. dollars. They would also need to decide which cryptocurrencies to accept. Bitcoin, Ether and USD Coin would probably be on their list”.


Although, we encourage diversity and decentralization in blockchain, we recognize that the current nature of the blockchain ecosystem presents challenges to existing and new users:

- It introduces a high learning curve for new users seeking to onboard the blockchain ecosystem even to do basic things like asset payments or transfer, and hampering the mass adoption of the technology.

- Because of the different tokens available, different people accept and back different tokens. As such, free exchange is stalled as a client may have one token and a service provider wants another.

- Also, blockchain wallets exist on different chains, and although an asset or token can be available on different chains they cannot simply be transferred among different wallets on the different chains.

- Again, although various DEXs are available to help convert one asset to another, not all allow cross-chain token transfers, or even wallet to wallet transfer.

- Again using a DEX presents an additional learning curve. As such only well skilled and well researched users can leverage DEXs to the max.

- Also DEXs are limited in the range of users they have because users have to be familiar with the range of services they offer, thus hampering DEX usage and adoption.

- According to the Deloitte survey, nearly 90% cited the complexity of making their existing financial infrastructure compatible with various digital currencies as their greatest challenge.

Payslice Protocol seeks to develop an open permissionless protocol that abstracts the technicality of blockchain asset transfers enabling users, developers, organizations, etc to accept and make payments with various assets on the blockchains. Think of Payslice as the SWIFT, Paypal and Paystack of web3. Payslice Protocol (not an app) will address the above mentioned challenges and gaps by:

- Providing a single click button that can be integrated into DApps to enable various kinds of payment such as cross-chain payment, on-chain payments, and cross-token payment. As simple as checking out a cart on an ecommerce platform. This means a low learning curve for getting involved in blockchain technology.

- This also means that regardless of the token you have you can pay for a service on a different token. Example. If you have Celo and a service is accepting cUSD, you can still pay for the service with your Celo as Payslice protocol will auto-convert your tokens and pay the service provider.

- Again Payslice protocol will also handle cross-chain wallet transfer and the user need not to worry about how the asset gets to their destination.

- Payslice steps in where different DEXs are not capable of delivering services such as on-chain wallet-to-wallet asset transfer, and cross-chain wallet-to-wallet transfer.

- Payslice also will seek to make REFI aligned DEXs a daily experience for users, thereby dramatically increasing DEX usage and their client base.

- As Payslice is a protocol and not a DApp, it can be used to power DApps that require payments or asset transfer. Thus relieving developers of DAOs, blockchain based and/or aligned E-commerce platforms, wallets, etc the headache of sophisticated payment integration, increasing the user experience in their DApps, while at the same time providing economic value to existing protocols such as REFI aligned DEXs.
