The earth protocol is an open suite of consumer and business products that will help combat climate change, the flagship product is an app called Sustain, a consumer-based application that helps individuals with a range of tools and opportunities to reduce their carbon footprint hence helping slow down climate change.

The Sustain app helps incentivize users for building sustainbale habits and actively contirbuting to fight against climate change. It will use Refi to help form a cycle to achieve net zero emissions in most regions. The earth protocol will implement a smart contract that will help regulate and facilitate the voluntary carbon market.

It will also have a lot of other focus areas like collaborations with other protocols for enhancing user experience as well as focus on research and development for better usecases for industries.

The Earth protocol will incorporate core concepts of Refi, NFTs and DAOs to build an ecosystem of tools and solutinos focued on solving climate change using Celo's carbon negative blockchain.
