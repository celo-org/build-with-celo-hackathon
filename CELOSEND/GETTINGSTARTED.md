- Once the wallet is created, its mnemonic will appear on the screen, do not forget to write it down on a piece of paper and do it in private, since this phrase will be the only way to recover your wallet, the CeloSend team will not be able to help you recover this account if you lose the mnemonic.

- Once this is done, you will have two options, if you only want to use our crypto wallet, you can proceed without filling out the KYC, which you can fill out later if you want to use our FIAT services.
