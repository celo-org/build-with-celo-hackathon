#### Project Description - Run3 a Metaverse you build while you move

RUN3 is a mobile app that involves fitness, gaming, social and REFI aspects with The Web3.
According to recent studies around quarter of human world population is not active enough, our objective is to motivate people to be physically active and healthy through Crypto and at the same time motivate them to be concient and help us to have a cleaner world. Any person can be benefiated from this product but specially people with a sedentary life style.

#### Summary

We will use alfajores testnet, for our App. We will have two main flows:

-Move to Earn Using an NFT Watch that we will automatically provide in the user's account the user will be able to record their steps, when the user reaches 100 steps (we are keeping this number low so is easier to test, in normal circumstances would be 10000), the user will receive a reward in our own ERC-20 token

-Move to Build Users can use the Earned tokens to create an NFT route, for this they can start walking and a route will be drawn while they move and it will show the tokens that need to be used, the bigger the route, the more tokens users will need, when the route is ready they can save it and they will have an NFT route, part of the RUN3 metaverse.

After this, other users can select this route, use it and share "Eco stories" with the NFT route owner, for example, let's say they found some trash on the sidewalk, they clean it and share the story. RUN3 team can later review the story and give a reward.
