### Project Name:

Grow A Child

Brief Description: ######

PROBLEM:
We at GrowAChild, are creating a crowdfunding web 3.0 platform for development of  rural schools/orphanages backed by verification, so that people can verify track and tokenize their donations, and in the process give back to the society for the development of children in underdeveloped countries, using the power of smart contracts, backed by our community token $GCFI.

STATISTICS:
1. An estimated 153 million children worldwide are orphans (UNICEF).

2. Asia holds the largest number of orphaned children, at 71 million â€“ India alone is home to 31 million orphans. This is followed by Africa, which harbors 59 million. 

3. Each day, 39,000 children are forced from their homes alone because of the death of a parent, family illness or abuse and abandonment.
COVID-19: Schools for more than 168 million children globally have been completely closed for almost a full year, says UNICEF

SOLUTION:
1. GrowAChild only approves trusted organizations after manual and automated verification (OTP-based) and then records their data on the blockchain
2. GrowAChild allows traceability of funds through smart contracts
3. GrowAChild allows periodic releasing of funds through smart contract, backed by submitted data and reports verifiable on chain.
4. Provision of individual dashboards to donors to understand the impact of their donation.
5. GrowAChild ensures automatic reimbursement of donations back to donors through smart contracts in case of project cancellation or other issues
6. $GCFI utility tokens are going to be used as a REFI token that will be issued back to the donors and later on to be available for trading/swapping.
