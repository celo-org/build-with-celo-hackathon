#### Project Description

##### PROBLEM

With about 2.5 million tonnes of plastic waste annually, Nigeria ranks ninth globally among countries with the highest contributions to plastic pollution. Unfortunately, over 88% of the plastic waste generated in Nigeria is not recycled (source).

It is not uncommon to find plastic waste (and other forms of waste) littered in public places. Most waste collectors barely earn a living wage, as they only sell to middlemen who pay them ridiculously low amounts. Also, many individuals are not incentivized to properly recycle waste, and litter them indiscriminately. At the same time, companies find it difficult to access reliable sources of used and recycled plastics, due to limited supply of properly collected waste materials, and the lack of proper infrastructure for collection and cleanups.

Gidiscrap wants to incentivize recycling and clean storage of used plastics, and also provide companies with reliable and transparent sources of recycled materials.

##### SOLUTION

GidiScrap is an open marketplace that directly connects buyers of used and recycled plastics with individuals and businesses who want to donate or sell them. To use the platform, companies that need recycled materials will stake cUSD (equivalent to the quantity of recycled or used plastics required) on GidiScrap. Individuals who sign up on the GidiScrap app are then notified of the new request, and can then gather plastics, deposit them in a collection center, and earn rewards from the cUSD staked by the buyer

Each request and dropoff is weighed and recorded with picture proof, and recorded on the Celo blockchain for traceability and verification. Apart from the cUSD earned, organizations who participate in the marketplace earn the GSCCredit NFT, a signal of their commitment to environmental sustainability.

To cover its operational costs, including technology costs, managing the dropoff centers, and logistics, GidiScrap receives a small percentage of the total amount disbursed for each request.

##### BENEFITS

    Individuals can earn extra income for collecting waste plastic with cUSD.
    Organizations can easily access a reliable source of waste, and at the same time empower low income earners in developing societies.
    Recording the dropoff on the blockchain enables the verification and certification of used plastics for organizations' supply chain.
    Auditability: The GidiScrap smart contract automatically processes the payment of cUSD after verified dropoffs. In cases where the order is not completely fulfilled, the smart contract automatically processes returns to the company's Celo wallet address.

#### Summary

FEATURES & ROADMAP

While this is not an exhaustive list of features of GidiScrap, it will serve as a roadmap for development during and after the hackathon:

    Location-based Alerts: Individuals enter their location when registering on the platform. They are then alerted of plastic requests in their location. This way, they don't need to travel long distances, and can donate to their neighborhood collection centers.
    SMS Alerts: for individuals and waste collectors who don't have a smartphone, we will trigger SMS alerts anytime there is a new request for used scrap.
    Transparency through the blockchain: Every record of requests, dropoffs, disbursements and returns is stored on-chain and processed by the smart contract. Additionally, the Celo blockchain allows easy registration of individual sellers using only their phone numbers.
    Payment through cUSD: The GidiScrap smart contract automatically processes the payment of cUSD after verified dropoffs. In cases where the order is not completely fulfilled, the smart contract automatically processes returns to the company's Celo wallet address.
    Dashboard: We will provide publicly visible dashboards with information on all requests, dropoffs, disbursements, and returns.
    GSCCredit NFT: Organizations and individuals who participate in the marketplace will earn GSCCredit, an NFT that signifies their commitment to environmental sustainability.
    cUSD Off-ramp for waste collectors: In the future, we will provide off-ramp options for individuals who either don't have a smartphone, or prefer receiving alternative rewards apart from cUSD. We will also partner with local merchants to enable individuals exchange their cUSD for goods.

During the hackathon, we will build the technical infrastructure required to operate GidiScrap, as well as most of the features of the roadmap. We will also designate at least one collection center in a neighborhood in Lagos for dropoffs.

In the future, we plan on leveraging AR & RFID technologies to reduce the need for drop-off centers, and allow individuals weigh and record their recycled plastics without having to carry them to dropoff centers. After successfully testing the pilot program in Lagos, we would firstly expand across other Nigerian cities, and eventually Africa. We would also partner with government agencies to create incentives and outreach programs for better waste management in African cities.
