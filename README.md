## ⚡ Sacuda, a community-based fintech for women who led bussiness ⚡ 

# Introduction

Sacuda aims at closing the US$94 billion financing gap for women-led MSMEs, reducing the challenges they face when applying for financing. There is a gap between supply and demand, this is mainly due to not considering the reality and needs of women's businesses when defining the credit requirements and/or evaluation scores. Financial institutions have been sustaining the assumption that WOB hold the same characteristics as male ones. However we know that their businesses tend to be smaller, which does not necessarily mean less potential. Thus, Sacuda is looking to develop an alternative credit scoring that combines indicators of financial capacity and business potential in order to provide greater access as well as the development of a business profile. This  will strongly contribute to the understanding of WOB that are part of the missing middle and therefore enable us to have the right credit model and provide tailored business support, direct advisory and matching with business development services (BDS) providers. Sacuda is a catalytic ecosystem that works by making business visible, sharing value, and using data science to provide the best services and experience possible for business women and entrepreneurs,  in a secure, transparent, and collaborative way.
