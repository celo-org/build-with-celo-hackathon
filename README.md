#### Project Description

Tumaini DAO is a non-profit Decentralised Application Organization that looks to empower the African Girl Child by:

1. Providing them access to:

- Funding towards girl-child rescue centers, and local NGOs to provide basic human needs such as food, water, education, and security.
- Projects that are initiated and overseen by the members of the DAO are aimed at raising standards of living for the Girl Child.
- Rescue missions from forced early marriages and female genital mutilation (FGM)
- Bridging the technological gap by providing computer literacy programs to these highly disadvantaged girls.
2. Implementing a Decentralised non-profit which replaces traditional donor funding that favors foreign foundations over local organizations where less than 2% of funding is given to local NGOs. This is contrary to the fact that local non-profits offered faster, cost-effective, and culturally appropriate aid. 

3. Using smart contracts to distribute funds according to votes by the members.

For these goals to be accomplished the organization will raise capital through :

- Ownership of the Dao's  Rehema Token that will allow members to vote on and propose projects, select project contractors, NGOs, and rescue centers to receive funds. 
- Selling of NFTs and accepting NFT donations
- Accepting Donations of cUSD, ether, and bitcoin.
- We are very excited to join the Hackathon to build, learn and have fun and we will support it beyond the campaign by expanding and growing the organization to other African countries.
