# Guess It!: Puzzle game built on top of Celo

This game is a simple puzzle game where answer and reward for question are stored on-chain. Answer will be hashed using Keccak256 and that hash is stored on-chain.

Current rewards are just in CUSD but in future other tokens will be added. Adding these tokens will give players additional incentives.
