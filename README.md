### Project Name:

Grow A Child

Brief Description: ######
This project is meant to open a first of its kind platform connecting philanthropists and orphanages using the power of Celo blockchain. Donors can check orphanage profiles and the exact reason why they are donating. Similarly the orphanages can create the exact needs for donations. However, the smart contract stays guard and watches over the fund allocation process.
