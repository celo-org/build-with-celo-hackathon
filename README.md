#### Project Description
Blockchain is meant to revolutionalize the world but 63% of the world's population don't have access to internet to leverage this technology. With the advancement in web3 over the past few years, a solution needs to be created for all, especially those without internet connection. The team plans to leverage the celo blockchain and attestation service to provide the blockchain infrastructure to user with feature phones. The implemetation includes mapping users phone number with a celo address, so they can carry out trasactions on the blockchain the same way internet users can. The plan after the campaign is to implement a p2p for these users to get values in their local currency.
