CNFT COLLEGE NON_FUNGIBLE TOKEN SYSTEM -This an auction based crowdfunding by nft assets for student organized events and clubs and transaction controlling platform and creates self economy zone like fun city into all colleges and our system collects tax from outside stalls for college managements during college events and during events and organizers (like rotaract,,NPO's,students organized clubs..) can set loyality points and our system provides an NFT trading platform with private tokens our tokens increases inter-college cash flows during events and promotes college events and create business opportunities for NFT traders, miners, designers,marketers,all college managements,students,stall merchants,students

 
 PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS
 
1.PROBLEMS:
Any common fundraising campign the volunteers faces problems like ignoring and slight downlook on who raises the fund and it is great psychological
problem for the volunteer 

SOLUTIONS:
We provide an futuristic solution by fundraising via NFT auction where the NFT can be exchanged by students as food tokens as reward and also act as an loyalty points system for fundraisers and this encourage doanators to raise more fund than usual collections those nft are designed and minted by the members of the organization or using our automated nft minting system by giving an theme related to the event which will be more intersting and event the nft can be traded over if its rare to get profited by the donators sometimes and nft minting is only controlled by organizations no individual can dump or create whale effect or spam

2.PROBLEM:
most of the initial stage organization ,events don't have standard banking proceedures instead all common money dumped in an individual account which is
potentailly dangerous as the organizers are impatient to open and manage a organization account and it is quite complicated in many countries and in many 
banks

SOLUTIONS:
So we provide and organization account ,merchant account trading account,student account,college management account with most simplest UI/UX and flawless tech support with KYC verification using college id with ergonomic limit settings

3.PROBLEM:
Since these fundraised events are in large gathering the event stall struggle to give and transact money in a shorter time and struggle without an temporary POS solutions or QSR tokens

SOLUTIONS:
So we provide 3 Static tokens "food" for food in event stalls and shops,"pellets" for games,"winr" for swap

4.PROBLEM:
All organization transaction's ledger statement commands are not shown to the members and it is not an open transaction so the donators are unsatisfied

SOLUTIONS:
So our system is easily accessable we provide an blockscout explorer or blockscout broadcast for every organization account

5.PROBLEMS:
students here about NFT,Crypto's,option tradings,forex ,equidity ,so student in this stream of interest may fall in trap by scammers in outside world in the name of expirementing these trading and trading platforms even though they have alternatives lik stimilators the experince in not satisfiable 
SOLUTIONS:
so we provide an early exposure to all these trading with minmal amount per monthly limit as safeplay trading to and organize hedge funding,angel investing to student project and business forums

6.PROBLEM:
The budgeting of Event is quite complicated and may go wrong in numbers of participants and the donators may lose interest cause of the mismanagements and there is no structural profit for collegemangement where individual stall merchants utilize large crowds even they get free electricity and space infractructre provided by college

SOLUTIONS:
So OUR TRANSACTION SYSTEM PROVIDES STATISTICAL DATA OF PREDICTING NO OF STUDENTS PARTICIPATING in events ACCURATELY as we have NFT ticket data and auction participants data and nof invitation readers data of our platform users and we PROVIDE AN SELF ECONOMY ZONE WITHIN COLLEGES AND WE PROVIDE QSR SERVICE AND COLLECT TAX ELGENTLY TO  COLLEGE MANAGEMENT AND PRESENT ANALYTICAL DATA TO THE MANAGEMENT ALL FUND RAISING CAN BE EVOLVED THROUGH FUTURE THROUGH OUR SPECIAL  PLATFORM CNFT WHERE WE USE NFT AS THANKS GIVING TOKENS AND ALSO LIKE AN LOYALTY POINTS AS COMPENSATION for that DIGITAL ASSET FOR FUTURE TRANSACTION WE DO COLLECT DATA AND GIVE PERSONALIZED COLLEGE RELATED ADS using our algorithms in our platform

7.PROBLEMS:

         Issues
                             
1. In some Countries private tokens are illegal to sell fiat rated products so we do not have inreturn exchange as we don't use common public exchange and once fiat currency dumped in our system users can only used it into our zone of food stalls, games or services as we provide legal ledger statement as donation in real time organization account 

2. Even though we track transaction record an this is a decentralized private blockchain we connect advanced blockscout explorer&broadcast service to track transaction for future legal issues regard investigation 

3. This tokens and NFT never will have value outside our system ,economic zones so each and every penny will be structed to spend within campus only and controlled with monthly limit

4. Some students may not aware of these systems and transactional methods and not practice to so it will be difficult to understand sometimes
